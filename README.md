# Dice-Game
Basic implementation of HTML, CSS, Java Script
It is the game in which there are two dice and both dice are rolled simulataneously when we refresh the page
If dice 1 shows greater number than Player 1 wins will appear on screen or if dice 2 has greater number than dice 1 Player 2 will be displayed on screen 
if both dice show same number draw will appear
I have used HTML, CSS, JAVA SCRIPT , DOM in this.
